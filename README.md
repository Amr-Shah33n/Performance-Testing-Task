# Performance-Testing-Task
The load test was performed on facebook.com. The test was performed twice with two steady state inputs

1.	A steady state load of one user maintained for 15 seconds
2.	A steady state load of 1000 users maintained for 15 seconds
3.	
Two detailed reports were created at both loads. Each report could be viewed via index.html present in each folder. The data.csv has the raw data extracted from the load test.
